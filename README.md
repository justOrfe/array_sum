Array Sum Project
This is a C program that calculates the sum of an array of integers. The user inputs the number of elements and then provides the numbers. The program calculates the sum and displays the result.

Features
User is prompted to enter the number of elements in the array.
User inputs each element in the array.
The program calculates the sum of the elements using a function.
The program prints the total sum of the array.
How It Works
The program first asks the user for the number of elements they want to sum.
The user enters the numbers, which are stored in an array.
The function sum_array() is called to calculate the sum of the array.
The sum of the array is then displayed to the user.
